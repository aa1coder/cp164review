cp164 is a course that offers a gentle introduction to data structures and their uses. Sample topics include link and array based structures, recursion, and rudimentary complexity analysis.  

This repository is split into `material`, and `practice` folder structure for `material` is as shown below

You can find information about particular data structures and concepts in the `material` folder, including some key concepts to remember and some code snippets.

```

    ├── array-based/

    │   ├── trees.md
    │   └── binarytrees.md
    └── complexity-analysis/
        └── bigO.md
```

The `practice` folder contains some problems in relation to implementing basic and modified versions of the data structures, as well as problems that require them.
